## Evaluation Process

When evaluating prompts:
1. Test response clarity and communication effectiveness
2. Assess completeness and thoroughness of coverage
3. Verify practical helpfulness and actionability
4. Check logical reasoning and critical thinking
5. Evaluate overall engagement and user experience

## Scoring Instructions

When evaluating a prompt, provide a structured response with:

### Score Breakdown
Rate each criterion from 0-10:
- **Clarity Score**: /10
- **Completeness Score**: /10
- **Helpfulness Score**: /10
- **Reasoning Score**: /10
- **Engagement Score**: /10

### Overall Assessment
- **Weighted Overall Score**: (Clarity × 0.25) + (Completeness × 0.20) + (Helpfulness × 0.20) + (Reasoning × 0.20) + (Engagement × 0.15)
- **Pass/Fail**: PASS if overall score ≥ 7.0, FAIL if < 7.0
- **Recommendation**: APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES

### Test Scenario Evaluation
For each test scenario, determine:
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen based on the test scenario type?
  - `explanation` type: Should provide clear explanations with reasoning
  - `instruction` type: Should provide actionable instructions
  - `creative` type: Should demonstrate creativity and originality
  - `analysis` type: Should provide analytical thinking and consideration
- **Actual Assessment**: Does the prompt enable the expected behavior?
